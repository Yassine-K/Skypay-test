Design Questions (Bonus)
1/- Suppose we put all the functions inside the same service. Is this the
recommended approach ? Please explain.

No, it's not recommended to put all the functions inside the same service. I would've created a service for the users, rooms, and booking
separately and create a Hotel entity to manage and link everything. This would dramaticaly improve the maintability of the code and makes
future code extensions way easier.


2/- In this design, we chose to have a function setRoom(..) that should
not impact the previous bookings. What is another way ? What is your
recommendation ? Please explain and justify.

I would use a copy constructor to copy the room entity to preserve a snapshot of the room's data when it was booked. I would only update
the rooms array and keep a hard copy of each room in the booking array.
